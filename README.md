## Environment

python = 3.6.8

tensorflow =1.13.1

opencv-python=3.4.2

numpy = 1.16.1

## How To Use It?

### 1. Go to tensorflow-vgg git, and make sure them run(I use VGG-19 and pretrained with imagenet)

### 2. Go to Ms-COCO Web Site and download COCO-Dataset 2014(because of use to training)

### 3. Modify some code in train.py and train_ori.py
#### train.py : line 13 ~ 16
#### train_ori.py : line 13 ~ 16
